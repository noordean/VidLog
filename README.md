# VidLog

A simple OTP app that runs everyday to log latest videos from my favorite youtube channels. These get logged into a csv file called vidlogs.csv in the root directory.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/noordean/VidLog.git
cd vid_log
```

See config/dev.exs for env setup

_run_:
- `mix deps.get`
- `iex -S mix`

**TODO: Replace CSV file with Ecto DB**
